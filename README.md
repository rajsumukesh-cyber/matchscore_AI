# AI Resume to Role Match Scorer

## Overview

**NexVersa** is a production ready AI SaaS platform that replaces hiring guesswork with explainable, evidence backed resume to role matching. It parses unstructured resumes and job descriptions, scores candidates against real role requirements, and returns transparent reports that both recruiters and job seekers can act on.

Instead of an opaque ATS "pass/fail", every score is traceable: matched skills, missing keywords, experience gaps, education alignment, and concrete rewrite suggestions.

## Problem

- Job seekers get rejected with no explanation and no path to improve.
- Recruiters manually skim hundreds of resumes per role.
- Traditional ATS keyword filters are opaque and drop qualified candidates.
- Hidden bias (names, age, gender, nationality) leaks into screening decisions.

## Solution

One explainable scoring engine with four modules on top of it:

1. **Match Scorer** : resume vs. job description scoring with category breakdowns, strengths, weaknesses, missing skills, rewritten bullet points, and an ATS readiness checklist.
2. **Recruiter Batch Screening** : queued, parallel screening of many candidates with live progress, automatic retries, and a ranked shortlist against a configurable cutoff.
3. **Bias Detection** : PII redaction (name, contact, DOB, age, gender, nationality) before AI scoring, plus biased wording scanning of job descriptions.
4. **AI Skill Gap Coach** : prioritized skill gaps, free course recommendations, practice projects, a weekly plan, and a projected score improvement.

## Key Features

- Explainable, category level match scoring blending LLM judgment with embedding similarity
- Resume ingestion from PDF, DOCX, and TXT (parsed in browser, never as server binaries)
- Reusable libraries of saved resumes and job descriptions with AI structured parsing
- Anonymous (bias safe) screening mode
- Role-based access: user, recruiter, admin with a dedicated Access Denied experience
- Admin dashboard: users, analyses, revenue, and average match score
- x402 micropayments in USDC on Base (EIP 3009 authorizations), with prices shown in ₹ INR
- Sandbox payment mode for testing without a wallet
- Public REST API that issues HTTP 402 payment challenges for external agents

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | TanStack Start, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion |
| Backend & Auth | Lovable Cloud (Supabase) with Row Level Security |
| AI | Lovable AI Gateway chat completions with JSON schema enforcement + embeddings |
| Payments | x402 protocol, EIP 3009 USDC authorizations via Viem |
| Storage | Private bucket for resumes with owner-only access policies |

Server logic runs as typed TanStack `createServerFn` RPCs; external/webhook traffic uses public API routes. All tables enforce RLS, roles live in a separate `user_roles` table checked through a security definer function, and sensitive actions are written to an audit log.

## Data Model (core tables)

`profiles`, `user_roles`, `resumes`, `job_descriptions`, `analyses`, `pricing`, `payments`, `audit_logs`, `screenings`, `screening_candidates`, `coach_plans`.

## Payment Flow (x402)

1. Client requests an analysis and receives a priced quote.
2. Server responds with an HTTP 402 challenge (amount, asset, receiver, network).
3. Wallet signs an EIP 3009 USDC transfer authorization.
4. Signed `X-PAYMENT` header is verified and settled server side.
5. The payment is atomically consumed by exactly one analysis, and a receipt is recorded.

If no receiving wallet is configured, the platform falls back to a clearly labelled sandbox mode.

## Roadmap

- Bulk recruiter ranking and role level leaderboards
- Live FX rates instead of a fixed USD→INR conversion
- AI-generated interview question sets per candidate
- Employer side analytics on funnel quality and bias trends
